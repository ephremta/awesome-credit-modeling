## Introduction

- [Consumer Finance: Challenges for Operational Research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40540227) - Reviews the development of credit scoring (the way of assessing risk in consumer finance) and what is meant by a credit score. It then outlines 10 challenges for Operational Research to support modelling in consumer finance.

- [Machine Learning in Credit Risk Modeling](https://james.finance/static/assets/whitepapers/Machine-Learning-in-Credit-Risk-Modeling-James-white-paper.pdf) - James (formerly CrowdProcess) is a now-defunct online credit risk management startup that provided risk management tools to financial institutions.  

- ['Lending by numbers': credit scoring and the constitution of risk within American consumer credit](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03085140601089846) - Examines how statistical credit-scoring technologies became applied by lenders to the problem of controlling levels of default within American consumer credit. Explores their perceived methodological, procedural and temporal risks.  

- [Machine Learning in Financial Crisis Prediction: A Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6069610) - Since the 1990s, machine-learning techniques, such as neural networks and decision trees, have been studied extensively as tools for bankruptcy prediction and credit score modeling. This paper reviews 130 related journal papers from the period between 1995 and 2010, focusing on the development of state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques, comparing them in terms of classifier design, datasets, baselines, and other experimental factors. It then presents the current achievements and limitations associated with the development of bankruptcy-prediction and credit-scoring models employing machine learning.

##  Institutional Credit Risk

- [Modeling Institutional Credit Risk with Financial News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08204) - Current work in downgrade risk modeling depends on multiple variations of quantitative measures provided by third-party rating agencies and risk management consultancy companies. As these structured numerical data become increasingly commoditized among institutional investors, there has been a wide push into using alternative sources of data, such as financial news, earnings call transcripts, or social media content, to possibly gain a competitive edge in the industry. This paper proposes a predictive downgrade model using solely news data represented by neural network embeddings.

- [Availability of Credit to Small Businesses](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2017-september-availability-of-credit-to-small-businesses.htm) - Section 2227 of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 requires that, every five years, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System submit a report to the Congress detailing the extent of small business lending by all creditors. The most recent one is dated September, 2017.  

- [Credit Scoring and the Availability, Price, and Risk of Small Business Credit](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/181124) - Finds that small business credit scoring is associated with expanded quantities, higher averages prices, and greater average risk levels for small business credits under $100,000, after controlling for bank size and other differences across banks.

- [Random Survival Forests Models for SME Credit Risk Measurement](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11009-008-9078-2) - Extends the existing literature on empirical research in the field of credit risk default for Small Medium Enterprizes, proposing a non-parametric approach based on Random Survival Forests (RSF) and comparing its performance with a standard logit model.

## Sample Selection

- [Reject inference, augmentation, and sample selection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706011969) - In-depth discussion.
